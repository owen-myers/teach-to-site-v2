                    moving fast and breaking things is often not an option. We approach wicked problems with 
                    a subtle curiousity, while equipping you to test assumptions. Dream big, but take incremental 
                    and apdative action.

                    society's first breath. Every second counts as their staff chisel away at the mile-deep 
                    stone wall of social progress. Instead of digging for wrecking balls, let’s use tech as 
                    a surgical tool. How can we improve one facet of one corner of one problem and build from there?

                    experiencing the problem itself. We embed community members into non-profit strategy as 
                    co-creators of solutions, a core tenet of design thinking. Bring the community along — 
                    build a boat for everyone.
